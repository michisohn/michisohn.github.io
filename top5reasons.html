        <h2>Top 5 Reasons</h2>
        <p> These are the top 5 reasons why Sarah Bugg is a bully - contact my email if you know more!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Compares her friends to animals.</li>
            <li>Is rude to staff in restaurants.</li>
            <li>Everyone knows that camels are herbivores and have a tough mouth that can chew thorny desert plants - humans can't do that so it makes no sense to be compared to such a creature as a human. Unless you want to hurt someones feelings. Sarah Bugg has been reported to often make this comparison. </li>
            <li> Kicks street dogs.</li>
            <li> A camel's hump does not store water as commonly believed. Instead, it stores fat, which the camel can break down into water and energy when nourishment is not available. This allows camels to travel long distances without food or water. Again, a very well known fact about camels - which again is missused by miss bugg. Do I look like I have fucking humps? Humps that store fucking fat and turn it into fucking water?? DO I LOOk LIKE REVERSE CAMEL FUCKING JESUS??!! No I do not. So the comparison doesn't make any sense and you should be ashamed of yourself.</li>
